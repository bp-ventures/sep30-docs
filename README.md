# BPV Stellar Blockchain SEP-30 Key Management Documentation

This repository contains documentation for BP Ventures Stellar XLM SEP-30 implementation.  
Stellar has [a reference implementation in Golang](https://github.com/stellar/go/tree/master/exp/services/recoverysigner),
but it's tightly integrated with Firebase and Twilio.  
BPV's SEP-30 implementation is more flexible and allows many types of authentication,
including Email, GitHub, and other social providers (Apple, Github, Google, Facebook, Microsoft).

### Motivation & Special features

Although recovery using email or phone is very common, it's not always available or reliable.  
Phone registration/recovery is usually done by sending an SMS with a code to the user. SMS is a widely available option, but it can get very expensive, as sending a SMS sometimes can cost a few dollars, specially when sending between different countries.
Email is also widely available, but there can be issues as well (it's not uncommon for emails to not get received by the recipient).
To take advantage of the many modern authentication mechanisms of today, we at BPV developed a SEP-30 recovery server that supports many different types of authentication:
- Email + code
- Email + password (with email confirmation link)
- Phone + SMS code
- Social logins (GitHub, Facebook, etc)
- TOTP (in development)
- ...and many others are planned to be added

This gives Wallets a rich set of options for deciding which recovery method to provide for their users. By using BPV SEP-30 server you also get access to our consulting services and development support.

### Stellar SEP 30 Playground Wallet Registration
- Click New Account
- Click Fund account to receive Stellar XLM 
- Copy the Connected account Key Pair to a text editor for temporary storage
- Click Configure severs
- click Register 1 (email)
- confirm your email
- Click Register 2 (Github) - Note in production this can be Google Authenticator (OTP), Github, Apple, Google or one of many other services
- Sign in to the social account
- Note for this process there will not be a device key generated - we may do so in the future
- We do not support SMS or phone number in this version as we have found the costs may outweigh the benefits to send SMS to some developing countries

### Stellar SEP30 Wallet Recovery Process
- basically SHIFT + CTRL + R to clear the browser
- copy in the public key (note in production they can recover using email address and not just public key)
- follow the recovery steps which are pretty self evident

Other notes:
- for support or feedback please email support@bpventures.us
- We would love to support you on your next project!

## Plans for this Project
- add additional social logins
- Potentially Passkey Biometric login (Face/Fingerprint)

   
## Stellar Wallet Registration Flow

This flow assumes:
- A Stellar Wallet compatible with SEP-30 and pre-configured to use two BPV SEP-30 recovery servers
- Two BPV SEP-30 recovery servers deployed:
  - First one requires Email authentication
